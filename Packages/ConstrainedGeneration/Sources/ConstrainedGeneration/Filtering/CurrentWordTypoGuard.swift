/// Drops beam branches whose *current word* — the stem the user already typed at the cursor plus the
/// model's continuation up to the next word boundary — completes into a misspelling.
///
/// ## Why this lives inside the beam (not as an end-of-run filter)
/// A misspelled tokenisation can out-score the correct one: `"tom"` + `"orow."` beats `"tom"` +
/// `"orrow."` because the typo splits into commoner sub-tokens with higher individual probability.
/// An end-of-run filter would (a) waste the beam's budget generating the typo branch's *continuation*
/// tokens — all conditioned on the wrong word — and (b) risk the correctly-spelled branch being
/// pruned by the typo's higher score before it is ever finalised. Judging a word the instant it
/// closes lets us discard the typo branch then and there, so every subsequent token is only ever
/// explored from correctly-spelled context. That is what "fix the word, then the next predictions
/// follow" means here: we do not patch letters in a finished string, we keep the branch whose later
/// tokens were generated under the correct spelling.
///
/// ## Conservative by construction (no false positives)
/// - Only a *closed* word is ever judged — a still-growing word is a valid prefix and is never
///   flagged (so `"orr"` of `"orrow"` is safe).
/// - Only fires when the user actually typed a stem at the cursor *and* the model added letters to
///   it; a completion that starts a brand-new word (after a space) is the model's own and is left
///   alone.
/// - Only all-lowercase, letters-only words are eligible. This skips proper nouns and
///   sentence-initial capitals (`"Tomorow"`), acronyms (`"NDA"`), camelCase identifiers, and
///   anything containing digits — all common false-positive sources.
/// - Never runs in `.code` / `.terminal` modes, where identifiers are not "typos".
/// - A word that already appears verbatim in the surrounding text (prefix or suffix) is kept: a
///   term the user is already using is treated as a personal-dictionary entry, not a typo.
/// - The recogniser itself is conservative and reports "recognised" whenever unsure.
